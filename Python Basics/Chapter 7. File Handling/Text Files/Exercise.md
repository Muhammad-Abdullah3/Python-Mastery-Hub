## Python Text File Handling Exercise Questions

1. **Word Counter:**
   Write a Python program that reads a text file and counts the total number of words in it. Exclude punctuation and consider words separated by spaces as distinct.

2. **Line Reversal:**
   Create a Python script that reads the lines of a text file and writes them back in reverse order to a new file. Preserve the line order within each line.

3. **Word Replacement:**
   Develop a program that reads a text file and replaces all occurrences of a specified word with another word. Save the modified text to a new file.

4. **CSV to HTML Table:**
   Write a Python script that reads a CSV file and generates an HTML table from its data. Save the resulting HTML to a new file.

5. **File Encryption:**
   Implement a Python program that encrypts the contents of a text file using a simple encryption algorithm (e.g., Caesar cipher) and saves the encrypted text to a new file.

6. **File Backup Tool:**
   Create a Python script that takes a backup of a specified text file, saving it with a timestamp in the filename.

7. **Markdown to HTML Conversion:**
   Build a program that reads a Markdown file and converts it into an HTML file. Handle basic Markdown syntax such as headers, lists, and links.

8. **File Merge:**
   Write a Python script that merges the contents of two text files into a new file. Ensure that the resulting file contains all lines from both files.

9. **Log File Analyzer:**
   Develop a program that reads a log file and extracts useful information, such as error messages or timestamps, and presents a summary report.

10. **Text File Search:**
    Create a Python script that allows users to search for a specific word or phrase in a text file and displays the line numbers where the word is found.
